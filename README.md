A full-stack application that allows users to upload videos to Cloudinary and dynamically pick the perfect thumbnailâ€”either by uploading a custom image or scrubbing through the video to select a specific frame.



## Key Features

* **Direct Video Uploads**: Seamlessly upload videos to a Cloudinary DAM account using the Cloudinary Upload Widget.
* **Chunked Uploads**: Automatically handles large files by uploading them in chunks for reliability.
* **Dynamic Frame Scrubbing**: An interactive slider allows for precise frame selection from the entire duration of the video.
* **Live Thumbnail Preview**: Instantly see a preview of the thumbnail as you scrub through the video.
* **Multi-Format Downloads**: Download the generated thumbnail in various formats (JPG, PNG, WEBP) on the fly.
* **Persistent Storage**: Video metadata, including duration and the selected thumbnail URL, is stored in a serverless Postgres database (Neon).
* **Modern Tech Stack**: Built with the latest features of Next.js, including Server Actions and the App Router.
* **Responsive UI**: A clean and responsive interface built with Tailwind CSS and Shadcn/UI.

* **Media Management**: Cloudinary (next-cloudinary)
* **Database**: Neon (Serverless Postgres)
* **ORM**: Prisma
* **UI Components**: Shadcn/UI
